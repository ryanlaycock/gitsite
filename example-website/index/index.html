    <p>Create base templates in HTML for the structure of your pages</p>
    <p>As much or little CSS and JavaScript can be written to fully customise your site</p>
    <p>Using standard templating we populate the templates based on content written in Markdown</p>

    <h1>Deploying them is a one-time job<h1>
    <p>We believe once your website is deployed, you shouldn't ever need to SSH in for updates</p>
    <p>As the GitSite runner is dockerised, you can run your website anywhere, from k8s, VMs or a RaspberryPi on your desk</p>

    <h1>Adding content is pain free</h1>
    <p>Writing content for your website should be _just_ that. That's why we use the much simpler to write Markdown</p>
    <p>Simply commit this to a (private if you desire) GitHub repo and GitSite will smartly pull the latest changes, while staying within GitHub's rate limiting restrictions!</p>
    <p>You don't need to write content in HTML or upload it directly to your website!</p>
